# Port Ethereum Network Stats (eth-netstats)

## Description
Ethereum Network Stats
[eth-netstats](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats) is a
web dashboard for visualizing the status of the Ethereum blockchain
and Decred currently lacks such a tool. This would give a heads-up
display of the various goings on in the Decred blockchain, e.g. block
number, average blocktime, average hashrate, graphs of several
statistics.

## Requirements
Familiarity with Node.js and some experience with HTML and
CSS. Experience with references to prior work.

## Scope
This work will require replacing JSON RPC calls to the Ethereum daemon
with calls to the Decred daemon. Any statistics that are not available
from or not relevant for Decred need to be disabled in the web
interface and backend, e.g. gas limit graph.

There may exist RPC calls for Ethereum that do not exist in Decred,
and in cases where it is not possible to port these calls, they may
need to be disabled.

Any external javascript should be disabled unless it is necessary for
the functioning of the site, e.g. remove Google Analytics javascript.

## Estimated Work
2 days FTE or greater (1 FTE = 40 hrs/week)

## Proposal
Proposals should include:

1. References to prior work on Node.js projects
2. Estimated completion time

## Milestones
Due to the limited scope of this RFP, there will not be any
milestones. Payment in full will be made when the port is completed.
